Abstract - One of the basic necessities of a human is shelter. As society advances towards the future, the infrastructure and
comfort have increased rapidly when it comes to property. But, there are still a lot of issues regarding buying property assets
because of fluctuation in demand for property with respect to areas.When people decide to buy a property, they must do a lot of
research beforehand. One of the major problems that arise when researching is by how much will the property’s market value
scale up in the future. It would require the users to keep track of the daily news regarding infrastructural development coming
nearby such as big construction projects by government (train stations, airport, etc.) and from private (malls, theaters, etc.). Apart
from that, we need to look after the basic amenities available in them vicinity such as hospitals, supermarkets, restaurants, etc.
This is mostly done through property brokers. Customers need to spend a certain amount in brokerage to get hold of good
property. To avoid wasting money in brokerage and to have insight about the market value of property in past, present and future,
we have decided to create a website that can be used to learn about the property’s market value and the infrastructures available
in the vicinity. Furthermore, users can analyze what are all the upcoming infrastructural developments to be implemented in the
locality. This website is not only limited to common people who want to purchase land for housing, but is also useful for real
estate owners and other people who wish to analyze the property’s market value. Users can analyze various places to compare
and select the best one according to their preference. If a user decides to buy a particular property in a place, but it is not available,
then our website will give valid suggestions for users to decide.
